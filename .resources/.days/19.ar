Prohibition Helps Lower Alcoholism#Al Cohol#During the 19th century, alcoholism, family violence, and saloon-based political corruption prompted activists, led by pietistic Protestants, to end the alcoholic beverage trade to cure the ill society and weaken the political opposition. This has caused a push for prohibition, and it has been finally passed. The passing of this law in January has caused many gangs to take control of the selling of these beverages.
America Refuses to Ratify the Treaty of Versailles#R. Fusal#The Treaty of Versailles ended World War I in March. President Woodrow Wilson was concerned with rebuilding the European economy, encouraging self-determination, promoting free trade, creating appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, creating a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace. He opposed harsh treatment of Germany but was outmaneuvered by Britain and France. This caused America to deny ratification of the Treaty.
America Doesnâ€™t Want Any Part of the Rest of the World#Lo N.#The U.S. Senate votes against joining the League of Nations, a multinational group whose goals are to keep peace between the world. First of all the United States had many German immigrants who hated the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty said that Germany and its allies were to accept full responsibility for causing the war and reparations were to be made to certain countries. The Treaty of Versailles was also the treaty that set up the League of Nations and not agreeing to it meant not being part of the League of Nations. Second, Americans did not want to risk more Americans dying in a European war, as they had in World War I. They also felt that it would result in pouring effort into pointless actions such as sending soldiers all around the globe to sort out small disputes. This attitude was called isolationism. Most Americans felt it would be best to avoid European and British affairs completely.
